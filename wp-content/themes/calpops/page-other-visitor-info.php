				<h2>Arrival Times</h2>
				<p>CPO's shows start at 3:00pm. Will Call and the Box office open at 2pm. Theater doors open a half hour before the show.</p>
				<h2>Bus Drop-Off and Bus Parking Details</h2>
				<p>Buses may unload passengers using the campus center utility road (handicap accessible). 
				This utility road is narrow and shared by the Police Department and Paramedics. 
				Due to this and traffic control individual cars may not utilize this drive way and buses are not allowed to park on this road. 
				No exceptions. Easiest & largest parking area for buses is at lot 6. See below map. Group coordinators will receive a detailed map with photos of the drop off area. 
				Click here (http://www.calpops.org/cpovenues.html) for bus driver instructions to the theater drop-off area and parking (a 1.9mb PDF).</p>
				<h2>Access Information for Patrons with Disabilities</h2>
				<p>Foothill College's Smithwick Theater is fully accessible. 
				Best Handicap parking is in Lot 5 and has a clear path without stairs to the theater. 
				There is limited wheelchair seating. Those sitting in the rear section enter the theater from the front doors. 
				Those sitting in the front section enter from the east or west side doors. Those with walkers will need to have their name or a clear identifier on the walker. 
				Once seated the attending usher will place the walker in the walker storage area and return it upon request.</p>
				<h2>Attire</h2>
				<p>There is no dress code for the California Pops Orchestra. Patrons generally wear business or casual clothing with comfortable shoes. 
				We recommend layers incase it does get a little cool at times. During Christmas time we welcome fun holiday attire (Santa & elf hats, rudolfe noses etc). 
				When there is a special occasions you can dress up especially for the season Opening at the Pops. Also for the Big Band show folks have come in Deco era attire adding to the spirit of the 30's & 40's.</p>
				<h2>Late Seating Policy</h2>
				<p>If you arrive late please do not enter the dark theatre. An usher is nearby to assist you. 
				Late seating will take place during the first convenient pause in the program. Ushers will have you temporarily sit or stand in the back of the theater until a break in the music. 
				At that time ushers will assist you to your reserved seats.</p>

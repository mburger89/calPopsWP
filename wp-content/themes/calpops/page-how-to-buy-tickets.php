				<h3>Ticket Service Fees</h3>
				<p>There are two ways for you to buy your Reserved Seating tickets for the Pops.</p>
				<p>1. The first is Online on the Pops' website (www.calcops.org). When you buy your tickets this way there 
				are 2 small fees added onto each order, a per-ticket fee of $1.50 and a shipping and handling fee of $3.00 
				per order (whether you buy 2 or 200 tickets, shipping and handling is always just $3.00 per entire order.)</p>
				<p>You save even more on Season Tickets because an entire set of 6 tickets for the season is treated as "one ticket" 
				so there's only a $1.50 fee for each season set of 6!</p>
				<p>
				Example - Two Season tickets<br>
				- $1.50 per set = $3.00<br>	
				- $3.00 S&H per order= $3.00<br>
				Total Online ticket fees = $6.00</p>
				<p>2. The second way to buy tickets is by phone with the Pops' office. The only fee that applies is the shipping and handling fee of $3.00 per order.</p>
				<p>
				Example - Two Season tickets<br> 
				- $3.00 S&H per order= $3.00<br>
				Total phone ticket fees = $3.00</p>
				<p>These fees do not go to the Pops but are charged by our very reasonable Ticket Service company. They're good folks. All tickets ordered will be 
				mailed with driving & parking information directly from the ticket service agency.</p>
				<p>That's it. Whether Online or by Phone we're delighted to offer Reserved Seating this season. Welcome!</p>
				<h3>Ticket Terms & Conditions</h3>
				<p>Each ticket constitutes a license from the CPO to the purchaser. No ticket may be transferred or resold for any price above the purchase price 
				printed on the ticket. By accepting a ticket, you are agreeing to the terms of this license. If these terms are not acceptable, please promptly 
				contact the CPO box office at (650) 856-8432 or email manager@calpops.org.</p>

				<h2>"Your kind of music! Your kind of orchestra!"</h2>
				<p>This motto is at the heart of the California Pops Orchestra. We have only one goal and that is 
				to bring the best, most entertaining pops shows to the Bay Area. As the nation's only all-request 
				Pops orchestra you can always count on the California Pops Orchestras' musicians and featured guests 
				to bring you fun, family-friendly shows with selections from the full range of the popular music 
				repertoire. Every one of the Pops performers loves the music of Broadway musicals, television, 
				Hollywood movies, jazz, pop, comic novelties, and big band.</p>
				<p>And this popular music is often scored for a unique set of instruments found in movie and recording 
				studios but not in classical symphony orchestras. Don't be surprised if you see flugelhorns, a saxophone 
				section, harmonicas, congas, whips, Theremins, accordions and other colorful instruments.</p>
				<p>The Pops includes many of the Bay Area's leading musicians with training from very distinguished 
				conservatories including Oberlin, Julliard, and the Eastman School of Music. The Pops also draws from 
				those in business and teaching with a diverse amalgamation of scientists, educators, engineers, marketing, 
				technology leaders and other highly creative individuals. This diversity in background plus a 
				single-minded purpose makes the Pops a delight to play with and a never-ending source of ideas, 
				inspiration and humor.</p>
				<p>On a serious note, the Pops is building a musical library that includes light classics, jazz, 
				Latin, movie, Broadway, TV, cartoon, circus, vaudeville and big band music. Many of these orchestrations 
				are long out of print and represent a uniquely American musical heritage that is quickly slipping away. 
				It is a vital part of the California Pops Orchestra's charter to preserve this heritage through the purchase, 
				restoration and live performances of this music in our communities. Ask any of our players how you can help 
				with this vital effort.</p>
				<p>Children are particularly delighted to be included in the Pops fun, especially at the Holidays! Give 
				them a holiday experience they will never forget!</p>
				<h2>Conductor Kim Venaas</h2>
				<p>Maestro Venaas has conducted, arranged and performed in all areas of popular, classical and 
				commercial music, from recordings to radio/TV to the concert and musical stage, from Davies Symphony Hall 
				to the St. Francis Hotel's Grand Ballroom. He was brought up on big band music and, in addition to the 
				California Pops Orchestra, has served as Carol Channing's Music Director and leads the Black Tie Jazz 
				Orchestra, a 19-piece professional '30s & '40s era society big band here on the West Coast. Herb Caen 
				called BTJO, "that great swinging band"!</p>
				<p>He has written and produced several Golden Age of Radio musical variety shows and works tirelessly 
				to preserve popular music around the country, assisting orchestras and music libraries including the 
				Paramount Theatre Library of Popular Music with a collection now exceeding 170,000 pieces of irreplaceable 
				American musical history.</p>
				<p>All Kim's musical experience in composing, arranging, conducting and recording has lead him back to the 
				show stage where he brings a relaxed, interactive style in the Pops' shows; a style free of the usual formal 
				separation between conductor and audience, a style where fun is the point.</p>
				<p>California Pops Orchestra is a 501c3 non-profit corporation with musicians from throughout the Bay Area 
				who have a passion for making the audience smile!</p>
				<p>See you at the shows!</p>
